## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. Here is a detailed description of how a **web3-calendar-app** would integrate with major centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

It's crucial to understand that this integration is not a direct, on-chain Web3 interaction but rather a bridge between the Web3 world (smart contracts, on-chain data) and the traditional Web2 world of centralized exchange APIs.

### Core Concept: The Bridge Between Web3 Events and CEX Execution

The primary function of the app is to monitor the blockchain (Web3) for specific, scheduled events and then trigger pre-defined trading strategies on a connected CEX.

**The High-Level Workflow:**

1.  **Event Detection (Web3 Side):** The app monitors blockchain calendars (e.g., Lemnis, DappRadar's token unlocks), project announcements, and on-chain data for predefined events like:
    *   **Token Unlocks:** Large, scheduled releases of tokens from vesting periods.
    *   **Governance Proposal Outcomes:** Results of votes that could impact a token's price.
    *   **Major Treasury Movements:** Wallets associated with projects moving significant funds.
    *
